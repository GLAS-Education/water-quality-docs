# Deployment Advice

This is our pre-deployment checklist, made public to help you deploy the sensor successfully: 

* Thoroughly test everything first
  * Ensure all systems (sensors) are functional
  * Check battery charge level
    * Don't deploy unless at least 80% remaining
  * Ensure housing is intact
    * Superglue any small cracks
    * Wires are tightly wound
    * No gaps in silicone sealant
    * Frame is sturdy
      * No loose joints
      * Zip ties are present and tightened
      * Two points of contact for the rope
* Test sensor once more at launch site
  * Plug it in and screw the lid shut
  * Connect to Bluetooth, ensuring that both Picos show up
  * Check if data is outputting correctly to verify all sensors are working
* Finally, carefully place the sensor into the on-site water
  * Do one last check for waterproofness
    * No obvious cracks or gaps
  * While keeping the platform as level as possible, attach the carabiner to the rope
